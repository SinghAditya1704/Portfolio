            Hello! My name is Aditya Singh, and I am a BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications) student currently studying <br>at ADYPU College. My passion lies in web development, and I am actively learning and honing my skills in <br>HTML and CSS to create captivating and user-friendly websites.
            <br><br>With a strong interest in technology and coding, I am dedicated to staying updated with the latest <br>web development trends and techniques. I am constantly challenging myself to improve my coding skills and <br>create visually appealing websites that are functional and responsive.

            <br><br>Apart from web development, I am also well-versed in other programming languages like JavaScript and <br>Python, which I believe add to my versatility as a budding web developer. I am always eager to learn and <br>explore new tools and frameworks to enhance my web development projects.

            <br><br>In addition to my technical skills, I am a diligent and motivated learner with excellent <br>problem-solving abilities. I am committed to delivering high-quality work and meeting deadlines. I am a <br>team player and thrive in collaborative environments, valuing effective communication and cooperation <br>with fellow team members.
